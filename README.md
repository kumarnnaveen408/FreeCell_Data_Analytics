# Understanding the Market
Before entering a new market, a company must conduct a thorough analysis to understand local customer behaviors. Preferences in one country can be vastly different from another, and a one-size-fits-all strategy often fails. This project simulates this scenario for a telecom operator named "FreeCell" looking to expand. The acquired dataset contains information on telecom customers such as; Customer Profile, Service Usage, Monthly charges, preferred payment methods, churn status etc.
